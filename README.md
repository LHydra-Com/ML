### Introduction

LHydra is a framework designed to simplify the development and deployment of recommendation systems. It offers tools for data preparation, model training, and evaluation, allowing users to focus on the specific algorithms and configurations for their needs.

### Installation

To set up LHydra locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone your branch**: Obtain the link to your development branch on Github. 
2. **Clone the repository**: Use the `git clone` command with the obtained link in your development environment. For example:

```
git clone https://github.com/LHydra-Com/ML/tree/dev-mode
```

3. **Verify directory**: Run `%pwd` in your development environment. It should return the name of the cloned folder.

4. **Change directory (if needed)**: If `%pwd` doesn't return the correct directory, use the `%cd` command followed by the path to your cloned folder location.

5. **Install dependencies**: Run `!pip install requirements.txt` to install the required libraries.

### Usage

This section will be filled with instructions on how to run LHydra, including command examples, input formats, expected output, and configuration options.

### Data Preparation

The Data Preparation section will explain how to acquire and preprocess data for your recommendation system. It will cover data sources, cleaning steps, and feature engineering techniques. 

### Model Architecture

This section will detail the recommendation algorithms available in LHydra. It might include diagrams, flowcharts, or pseudocode to illustrate the models. Additionally, it will mention any pre-trained language models or embeddings used by the framework.

### Evaluation Metrics

The Evaluation Metrics section will specify how LHydra measures the performance of recommendation models. It will discuss metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Contributing Guidelines

This section will encourage collaboration by providing information on contributing to the LHydra project. It will cover details on pull requests, code style guidelines, and issue tracking.

### License

LHydra will be released under a specific license. This section will state the license type and provide a link to the full license text.

### Acknowledgments

This section will thank any contributors, libraries, or resources that inspired the development of LHydra.

By following these steps and referring to the upcoming sections, you will be able to set up, use, and potentially contribute to the LHydra recommendation system framework.
